# 👋 Hi, I’m AaronJoel Parker 

### 💼 DevOps Engineer | Platform & Infrastructure Builder | Accessibility-Focused Engineer

[![CKAD](https://img.shields.io/badge/CKAD-Certified-blue?logo=kubernetes)](https://ti-user-certificates.s3.amazonaws.com/e0df7fbf-a057-42af-8a1f-590912be5460/f76d4105-928d-4224-ad24-ea9b92e74fb3-aaron-parker-3dcc81e7-5c80-48ff-a45e-28911be160fe-certificate.pdf)

I’m a DevOps-oriented engineer with a strong software engineering foundation, specializing in **containerized infrastructure**, **Kubernetes-based platforms**, and **modern backend systems**. My work focuses on building reliable, automation-first systems that support **real-time communication**, **data-intensive workflows**, and **accessibility-focused research platforms**.

I care deeply about **operability, clarity, and system correctness**, especially in environments where reliability directly impacts users.
