# 👋 Hi, I’m AaronJoel Parker

### 💼 DevOps Engineer | Platform & Infrastructure Builder | Accessibility-Focused Engineer

I’m a DevOps-oriented engineer with a strong software engineering foundation, specializing in **containerized infrastructure**, **Kubernetes-based platforms**, and **modern backend systems**. My work focuses on building reliable, automation-first systems that support **real-time communication**, **data-intensive workflows**, and **accessibility-focused research platforms**.

I care deeply about **operability, clarity, and system correctness**, especially in environments where reliability directly impacts users.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

- **DevOps & Platform Engineering**
  - Kubernetes-based application platforms (multi-tenant)
  - CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation
  - Linux-based infrastructure and containerized workloads
 
- **Backend & Systems Engineering**
  - Node.js services and GraphQL APIs
  - PostgreSQL, Redis, and data-layer design
  - Real-time and event-driven architectures

- **Automation & Tooling**
  - Infrastructure scripting and internal tooling
  - CLI-based workflows for developer productivity
  - GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Terraform (active use and expansion)

- **Accessibility & Applied Research**
  - Infrastructure and platforms supporting Deaf/HoH research
  - Real-time video and communication systems
  - Applied AI tooling used as an engineering accelerator, not a replacement

## 🚀 Selected Projects


- **Glyphic CLI**  
  CLI-first automation toolkit for developer workflows, résumé generation, and infrastructure-oriented scripting.

- **VueCue XR**  
  Research-grade WebRTC and real-time communication platform optimized for ASL, interpreters, and visual accessibility use cases.

- **Insight Engine**  
  Data analysis and ML-assisted workflows for small, high-signal research datasets in accessibility-focused studies.

- **Distributed Agent Experiments**  
  Lightweight, containerized service networks using gRPC and orchestration patterns to explore scalable automation and coordination.
